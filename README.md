# Data Science Projects by Yumna Ehab

Welcome to my collection of data science and machine learning projects
Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem using Python and common ML libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## ðŸ“Š Projects Included:
1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**â€“ Predicting which passengers survived using logistic regression.
2. **Spam Email Detection** â€“ Classifying text messages as spam or not spam using NLP techniques.
3. **Customer Churn Prediction** â€“ Identifying telecom customers likely to leave using Random Forest.
4. **Iris Flower Classification** â€“ Predicting flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack:
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ’¬ About Me:
Iâ€™m a recent graduate passionate about **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Cloud Computing (AWS & Oracle)**.  
I love building simple, explainable models and continuously improving my technical skills through hands-on projects.
